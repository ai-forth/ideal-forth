## ideal-forth

A project to investigate the ideal algorithm in the Forth language. The idea is to follow closely the paradigm established by [Leo Brodie](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/) in the 1981 book _Starting Forth_.

### Background

When completing both the ideal algorithm in C# _and_ taking the time to understand M6809-multicomputer, it seems wise to have a look at this language and see if it can help solve bottlenecks with aiventure-david, now _joi_.
