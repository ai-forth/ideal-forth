## ideal-forth

In a nutshell: An awesome stack based programming language, which is able to extend itself during runtime.

A codebase to reflect the paradigm established by [Leo Brodie](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/) in the 1981 book _Starting Forth_.

### Why?

* When completing both the ideal algorithm in C# _and_ taking the time to understand M6809-multicomputer, it seems wise to have a look at this language and see if it can help solve bottlenecks with aiventure-david, now _joi_. Can't say it here, but see its evolution called [five](https://github.com/cartheur/ideal-five).
* Forth's syntax and mechanations are the underpinning of [Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7Vz6r6p1o4).

### This distribution

The goal here is to establish a new paradigm for forth by echoing several goals:

* It should be a model, i.e. it should define all the implementation-dependent things.
* It should become standard, i.e. widely accepted and used. I proffer a robotic personality.
* Minimalist yet should provide for all the things that are considered necessary now and foresee what is on the horizon.
    - A predictive capability.
    - Anticipate.
    - Establish the paradigms of [ideal](https://github.com/cartheur/ideal).
* Be wickedly fast.    
* OOP. There's an object oriented [package](/releases/oof.zip), written in almost plain ANS Forth.
