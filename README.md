## ideal-forth

An awesome way to get things done at the level of the machine. Here will be applying self-extension during runtime. Sure a _imperatively dangerous_ task, but who cares what people have said about this topic over the years. Look at the state of things!

A codebase to reflect the paradigm established by [Leo Brodie](https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/) in the 1981 book _Starting Forth_.

### This distribution

The goal here is to establish a new paradigm for forth by echoing several goals:

* It should be a model, i.e. it should define all the implementation-dependent things.
* It should become standard, i.e. widely accepted and used. I proffer a robotic personality.
* Minimalist yet should provide for all the things that are considered necessary now and foresee what is on the horizon.
    - A predictive capability.
    - Anticipate.
    - Establish the paradigms of [ideal](https://github.com/cartheur/ideal).
* Be wickedly fast.    
* OOP. There's an object oriented [package](/releases/oof.zip), written in almost plain ANS Forth.
